# Frequentist vs Bayesian probability

The overarching goal of both approaches is the same: to make a statement about the population (*all* data points) based on a *sample* of data points, and describe our uncertainty about that statement.

Suppose we’re interested in the average height in inches, AKA h, of all adult males in the U.S.

| Ask           | What is the probability of our data given a true and fixed population mean?
